## Problem to solve
You should create a simple app that shows metadata for episodes and podcasts. The data that should be used is located locally (`app/src/main/assets`) in the app in this early development stage. The app should cointain the following:
1. Two lists, one with podcasts and one with episodes. 
2. A landing page for a podcast
3. A landing page for an episode

The landing pages should be shown when the user clicks on a list item.

### Metadata 
#### List items
A podcast item needs to have:
- Title
- A part of the desciption
- The number of episodes

An episode item needs to have:
- Title
- A part of the desciption
- The length of the episode
- The date when the episode was created

#### Podcast landing page
It needs to have:
- Title
- The full description
- The number of episodes

#### Episode landing page
It needs to have:
- Title
- The name of the podcast
- The full description
- The length of the episode
- The date when the episode was created

## Design 
You are free to design the app in the way you want, but we like material design.

## Data location
The data is located in:
`app/src/main/assets`
It cointains two lists. One with podcasts (6 items) and one with episodes (4 items). 

## Requirements
- It needs to look great in phones (does not matter if it looks bad in tablets)
- The lists must support a lot of items.
- Do not make the task harder than it is. It can be solved in one or two hours.
- You do not need to write tests (but if you want to write tests, you are free to do it)
